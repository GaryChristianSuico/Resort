            <h2><span class="primary-text">Our</span> Beach Resort</h2>
            <p>
                The beach, which is located on southern Mindanao's east coast, offers a breathtaking view of the ocean
                without any obstructions. You will see the horizon and deep blue sky for about 180 degrees when you are
                away from the coast. The environment within the resort is a veritable tropical paradise. There is a
                grove of palm trees and shoots all around the land. Even inside the resort, the trees are tall and
                robust, providing just theright amount of shade. Everything, including the rooms, reception area, and
                picnic tables, is situated on top of the white sanddue to the soft sand that extends well inland.
                feeling the soft sand between your toes when you go outside your room!
